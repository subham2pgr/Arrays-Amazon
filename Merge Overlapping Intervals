see the most efficient soln that is on place array soln from video and the code too.the geeks soln for inplace soln is wrong.

A O(n Log n) and O(1) Extra Space Solution
1) Sort all intervals in decreasing order of start time.
2) Traverse sorted intervals starting from first interval, 
   do following for every interval.
      a) If current interval is not first interval and it 
         overlaps with previous interval, then merge it with
         previous interval. Keep doing it while the interval
         overlaps with the previous one.         
      b) Else add current interval to output list of intervals.
Note that if intervals are sorted by decreasing order of start times, we can quickly check if intervals overlap or not by comparing start time of previous interval with end time of current interval.



bool mycomp(Interval a, Interval b)  
{ return a.s >b.s; }
decreasing order
